# User Workflow Examples

High-level flow for Groove Wanderer:

1. **Evolve** — Load the device; patterns start evolving from the library based on current knob positions.
2. **Steer** — Adjust complexity, density, and change-rate knobs (and chaos) to move through groove space.
3. **Capture** — When something interesting appears, mark a region with CAPTURE START and CAPTURE STOP.
4. **Export / Loop** — Create a MIDI clip (EXPORT), or loop the captured region (LOOP) and apply mutations (Bank B knobs).

For step-by-step scenarios (explore & capture, layered loop, mutate loop, save/recall), see [examples/session-scenarios.md](../examples/session-scenarios.md).

For button and knob layout, see [BUTTON_MAPPING.md](BUTTON_MAPPING.md).
